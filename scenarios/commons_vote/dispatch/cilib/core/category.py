    on a traced value is not). The off-branch is ``identity``, so a gate that is
    off reproduces the ungated baseline exactly — which is how "every gate
    defaults to off, reproducing the baseline" is expressed here: you simply do
    not compose the gated transform in, or its predicate is ``False``.

    The predicate may close over the scan index to build a time gate, e.g.
    ``gated(lambda s: t >= t_shift, per_community_attention)`` inside a
    ``round_fn`` that has ``t`` in scope.
