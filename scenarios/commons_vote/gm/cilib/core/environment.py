# core/environment.py
"""
Simulation environment built on transform-based stepping via jax.lax.scan.

The environment holds an initial GraphState and a composed Transform.
Running the simulation applies the transform T times via lax.scan,
producing a final GraphState with filled metric arrays.

Termination is handled via an 'alive' flag in global_attrs — the scan
always runs T iterations, but transforms become no-ops when alive=0.
