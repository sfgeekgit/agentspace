"""
Temporal foundation for Collective Intelligence Library — the EAGER tier.

Time is discrete: a monotonically increasing tick counter.
Events happen at specific ticks and have duration.
The World is (tick, GraphState, EventLog).

TWO TIERS OF TIME
-----------------
This module (``World`` / ``Event`` / ``EventLog`` / ``tick_world`` /
``run_n_ticks``) is the **eager tier**. It is the right home for things that
cannot live inside a compiled loop: genuinely effectful agents (the
``LLMAgent`` HTTP port), append-only event logs with duration, and host-side
prediction resolution (``core/predictions.py``, which works over Python lists
of events and string ids). The ``run_n_ticks`` loop is a plain Python fold and
``tick`` is carried in ``global_attrs``.

For PURE simulations — where every agent and the world are side-effect free —
use the **pure compiled tier** in ``core/scan.py`` (``run_scan`` /
``run_scan_batch``) instead. There the whole run is one ``jax.lax.scan`` that
``vmap``s over seeds/dials as a single program, which is what makes large
sweeps cheap.

Important: ``GraphState.global_attrs`` is *static* pytree aux (see
``GraphState.tree_flatten``). Storing ``tick`` there, as ``tick_world`` does, is
fine on this eager tier but must NOT be relied upon inside ``jit``/``scan`` —
on the scan tier, time is the scan index and per-step state lives in the array
children, never in ``global_attrs``.
