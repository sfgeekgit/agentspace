"""
Auto-generate a metrics Transform from a dict of metric functions.

Each metric function is GraphState -> JAX scalar. The generated transform
writes values into pre-allocated arrays in global_attrs via .at[step].set(),
which is fully JIT and lax.scan compatible.

Usage:
    metrics = {**ECONOMIC_METRICS, **GOVERNANCE_METRICS}
    # Pre-allocate in state factory:
    for name in metrics: global_attrs[f"metric_{name}"] = jnp.zeros(T)
    # Append to pipeline:
    pipeline = sequential(..., make_metrics_transform(metrics))

    """Create a transform that fills pre-allocated metric arrays in global_attrs.

    The for-loop over metrics unrolls at JAX trace time (static dict iteration),
    so each metric becomes a traced operation in the computation graph.

    Requires:
        global_attrs must contain 'metric_{name}': jnp.zeros(T) for each metric.

    Args:
        metrics: dict mapping metric name to a pure function GraphState -> scalar.
