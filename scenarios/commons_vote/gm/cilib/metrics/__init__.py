"""
Composable metrics system for Collective Intelligence Library simulations.

Metrics are pure functions (GraphState -> scalar) organized into families
by theoretical lens (economic, governance, graph theory, etc.).

A metrics Transform auto-generated from a dict of metric functions writes
scalars into pre-allocated arrays in global_attrs at each step, compatible
with JAX's lax.scan and vmap.
